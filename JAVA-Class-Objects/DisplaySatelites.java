/*Suppose we want to represent a planet in the solar system as an object of class Planet. In
the object, it contains two fields: one called name is a String containing its name, and one
called satellites is an array of String containing the names of all its satellites. Define the
class, with a constructor taking a String and an array of String as argument for initializing
the object.
Write a method print() in the  class to print out the name of the planet and all the satellites.
For example, if we have
String[] earth_sat = { "Moon" };
Planet earth = new Planet("Earth", earth_sat);
Then we want  earth.print(); to print out the following:
Earth has 1 satellite(s):
Moon.*/
